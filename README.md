# Snake

This is a simple game of snake created by me with a few twists.
The only dependencies for this project is the package pygame.

Different files have different abilities / different game modes:

# main.py

This is the classic snake game with some added gimmicks.

Enemy snakes appear (three of them) and chase you down. If they catch your snake you will lose three lengths.
The apple can be eaten, but each time you eat an apple, a block appears which you cannot use anymore.

# level1.py

This is a more level based idea of snake. The goal of this game is not simply just to survive, but beat the level.
This features teleporters, apples, blocks, keys, and openings.

This is not as polished as the "main.py" script but good enough to share.
